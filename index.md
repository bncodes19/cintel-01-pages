# Brett's Website

My first website using Markdown and GitHub Pages.

## Links (Two hashes is a second level heading)

Here's a clickable link: [My favorite AI assistant](https://chat.openai.com/)

Here is my favorite data visualization site: [Visual Capitalist](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/)

## Reminders

Use a dash space for unordered lists

- Spaces matter

- Spelling matters

- Capitalization matters
